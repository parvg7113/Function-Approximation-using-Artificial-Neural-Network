# Function-Approximation-using-Artificial-Neural-Network
This small self-project aims to approximate a non linear function  in two variabes (within in a certain interval) through ANN. A simple approach is to use standard python libraries like TensorFlow, Scikit-Neural Network etc. However this activity aims to implement a neural network architecture from scratch with deploying these high level ML-libraries.

Below steps were followed:
1. Program a python script to implement an ANN with one (or even two for additional complexities) hidden layer and ReLU activation.
2. Generate 500 randomly selected data points within a specific interval for training and another 200 data points for testing.
3. With a learning rate of 0.00001, train the above model for about 1 lakh epochs through forward propagation and backproagation algorithms to optimize your weights and biases for each layer.
4. Use Test Cost function to evaluate model predicitions and hence analyse performance.
